# Pocket Mortar

**Pocket Mortar is a fork of [WARDOGS Artillery Calculator](https://github.com/apollyon-sys/wardogs-calculator) by [Apollyon](https://github.com/apollyon-sys)**, made with the author's permission and released under the same [MIT License](LICENSE). The original project and its author deserve the credit for everything the calculator does today. Live at **https://pocketmortar.com/**.

What this fork changes:

- **No analytics, no tracking.** The upstream Umami tracker is removed.
- **Group / cooperative targeting** (in development): share a target list with your squad using a short code, with an optional passcode, so several mortars and guns can work the same targets. Each member's range and MIL are computed locally from their own position.
- Branding and domain. Nothing else is intentionally different, and improvements are offered back upstream as pull requests.

Branch layout: `main` tracks upstream unchanged (for clean pull requests); `site` carries the fork-only changes and is what deploys to pocketmortar.com.

## Interfaces

The project ships two interfaces from the same repository and GitHub Pages deployment:

- **Desktop** — `/`
- **Mobile** — `/mobile/`

Phones are automatically routed from the desktop entry pages to the matching mobile route. The mobile UI is a separate map-first interface with touch panning, pinch zoom, touch-friendly point placement, Map Tools, and a bottom-sheet calculator.

Both interfaces reuse the same calculator logic, maps, tile pyramid, configuration, translations, saved targets, drawings, and browser storage.

## Localization

The shared locale system supports English, Russian, Ukrainian, German, French, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and the non-indexed Cat locale.
